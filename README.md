<h2>Higher Lower Game</h2>

The "Higher or Lower" game, also known as "Higher Lower," is a simple and entertaining card game where players attempt to guess whether the next card in a sequence will be higher or lower in rank than the previous one. Using the same concept, in this game the player will be given 2 accounts from a instagram list and the player will try to guess who has more followers. If user chooses correctly, a score will be tracked. The next round the user will have to guess again who has more followers and the new account will be compared with the last account from the previous round.
